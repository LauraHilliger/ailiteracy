# New website
After experimenting with a [website within 1024 bytes](https://github.com/dajbelshaw/1024B) I'm tinkering with a way of creating a really small (but larger than 1KB) replacement for dougbelshaw.com.

Uses colours from the <a href="https://www.nordtheme.com/">Nord theme</a> and emojis from <a href="https://emojipedia.org/">Emojipedia</a>. Inspired by the approach of <a href="https://maczan.pl">maczan.pl</a>.
