 <p>On Monday 3rd October 2011 I submitted my doctoral thesis to Durham University. After successfully defending it in my <em>viva voce</em> and making some minor changes, I graduated in April 2012.</p>		
 <p>I wrote my thesis in the open, on a wiki at neverendingthesis.com which now redirects here. The thesis has a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0 license</a> which means I have donated my work to the public domain.</p>
 <p>Just before graduating, I had the opportunity to give an overview of the findings from my doctoral work in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8yQPoTcZ78">TEDx talk</a> at the University of Warwick. This was an important opportunity for me to explain complex things in a simpler way.</p>        
  <p>Subsequently, I rewrote and updated my thesis as an ebook entitled <em>The Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</em> with v1.0 being finished by mid-2014. This has been used as a set text on postgraduate courses in (to my knowledge) Canada, the UK, and Australia.</p>  
  <p>These three artefacts: my thesis, ebook, and TEDx talk are collected below for the benefit of those that still find them useful. The wiki that I wrote the thesis on is available via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201130014526/http://neverendingthesis.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
  <p>I continue to consult and present on digital literacies and am particularly interested in how disinformation is propagated online &mdash; as I discussed in a keynote entitled <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/speaking.html">Truth, Lies, and Digital Fluency</a>.</p>
