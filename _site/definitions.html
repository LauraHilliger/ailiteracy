		"While there have been numerous conferences focused on AI education in formal settings, our focus is specifically on a human-centered approach that prioritizes the needs of underserved communities, as well as the responsibility and agency humans possess in the "care and feeding" of AI systems. This entails not only promoting people's conceptual understanding of AI and its workings, but also developing critical AI literacy understandings and skills that empower individuals to recognize the role we all play in AI systems that impact nearly every aspect of daily life."

		"We define AI literacy as a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace. We conducted an extensive review of literature... and distilled a set of key AI literacy competencies and considerations for designing AI literacy learning interventions, which can be used to guide future educational initiatives as well as foster discussion and debate in the AI education field."

	<blockquote>
		"AI literacy is a multifaceted concept that goes beyond a mere understanding of AI technologies. At its core, AI literacy involves the having the skills and competencies required to use AI technologies and applications effectively.
		<br>
		It's about viewing these technologies critically, understanding their context, and questioning their design and implementation. It's also about being able to discern the benefits and challenges of AI while making informed decisions about its use."
